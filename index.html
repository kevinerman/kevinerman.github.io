            <span3>         Hi there! My name is Kevin Erman and on behalf of my serious, unsmiling face, I'd like to thank you for stopping by to check out my portfolio! 
             I'm a new website developer with an Associate's Degree in Performance Theater for some reason.
             I grew up in Dayton, Ohio, but five years ago I decided to trade chilli dogs for deep dish pizza and move out to Chicago.
             Okay actually I still eat plenty of chilli dogs but now I eat deep dish pizza too. Variety!

             Over the years I've built up an extensive background in customer service with over 10 years of retail experience.
             I learned with first hand experience how to deal with a wide variety of customer issues both as an associate and as a manager.
             My retail experience also helped me to learn many songs by heart, often against my will, simply by hearing them so many times.
             No bonus points for guessing why I left retail!

             I spend my free time losing to 12 year olds in Fortnite, watching superhero shows on TV, and performing improv comedy.
             One day I would like to leverage all of the time I've spent playing video games into creating them.
             Until that time comes I would be satisfied with one Battle Royale win in Fortnite. Seriously why are these 12 year olds so good at this game?
